## Today, hearing-impaired people often find themselves left out in overwhelming soundscapes, such as crowded malls, family gatherings, or cocktail parties. Existing devices often fail to provide an optimal solution, leaving them isolated. The official name for this condition is Cocktail syndrome, and it poses a critical challenge for developers.

We address the Cocktail Syndrome by relating combinations of frequency and amplitudes as objects.

Together with my advisor, Prof. Reuven Ianconescu, we decided to create a simulation to test Machine Learning algorithms for sound separation by sources. 

## Sorona is a simulation that tests supervised machine learning algorithms.

To tackle this challenge, Sorona offers AI audio separation, identifying and separating sources during valuable conversations. It listens and utilizes the user's location, enabling them to control the surrounding sounds.

Sorona offers a Dataset test.

It matches the Deep Mask and trains to create a Deep Mask.

Sorona compares the Deep Mask with a ground truth (original signals) and a Wiener Filter.
